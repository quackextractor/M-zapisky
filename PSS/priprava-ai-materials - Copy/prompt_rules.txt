Environment info:
- cisco routers and switches
- linux ubuntu rasberry PIs
- windows 10 computers

Return the following:

- configuration table containing IPs, switches, routers, other devices, etc.
	- if information is unknown or not specified, come up with values that work in the given situation\
	- e.g. assignment requires one router to be in a specific state, exactly outline which router is the one and write code blocks accordingly
	- specify how the devices should be connected (what interface names)
- message in markdown form (DO NOT wrap the whole document in ```markdown ```, do wrap the codeblocks)
	- title of codeblock with brief description
	- codeblocks containing the configuration commands without the prompt indicators (Router> and Router#, etc.)
	- do not write comments into codeblocks
	- do not explicitly write to memory (persistency not needed)
	- ensure each codeblock starts and ends in the same EXEC mode
	- ensure the entire codeblock can be pasted in as is without further modification
	- do not make indentations inside of codeblocks
- return configuration code blocks for each router/switch
	- any device that was not explicitly said to be set up in the assignment will have to be set up
	- do this even if the scripts are similar, as absolute convenience with zero tech knowledge required is needed
- return codeblocks for verifying functionality and assignment completion after user configures everything
	- also specify expected outputs
